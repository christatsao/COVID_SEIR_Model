# COVID_SEIR_Model

These notebooks simulate a virus propagating through a population. The starter code is the initial code created to show the basic logic, and main is the full program that graphs the spread of the virus. It also models how social distancing will affect the propagation of a virus. 

You can compare the results to the real life COVID-19 graphs of the spread of the virus.
